# Welcome to our site src :

## This was my project for the founders & coders week 2 of the boot camp  - its pair programing boot camp - i were paierd with @tamerNasser up to this point, but all the changes in my repo are done by me 

### Once you at the site you can finde the weather on the top left , time and date at the top right , and a contact us button at the top mid that will take you for the team who build the site.

### Then you you will find a *search* bar where you can search for images in Instegram by #hashTag and get the most popular/recent images.  
# Required:
### To reach the full site you need to clone the repo and run it localy(for now), then reach us to supply you with the token key.
### after that you need to add new file called config.js at the gihub folder.
### Enjoy.
